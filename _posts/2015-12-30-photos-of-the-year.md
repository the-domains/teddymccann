description: "Photo by Stan Badz, PGA TOUR Staff Photographer (SB): Tiger Woods seemed to levitate above the gallery as he jumped along the cart path to see a clear shot to the green at the 2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open. Combined with the variety of facial expressions on the faces of fans, I couldn't help but smile when I took this photo."
